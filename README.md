# AI Solver

This is my **AI Level Solver** software. I decided to make this program to work with updating, reusing, and keeping track of data while having software solve something. 

This program creates a very simple mario kind of level that the players will try to solve (5 players at a time). After all players die, the player that made it the furthest will become the base for the next generation of 5 players. This repeats until they reach the end and the level is complete.

# Future Work

* Make levels more difficult and add more levels
* Use multiprocessing to make the program faster
